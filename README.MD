# compiled-web-concept
## Nowdays
Websites are interpreted by the webbrowser.   
This is wasteful: there are no barriers to compile html and css, but because of the dynamic typing of JS
, sites are not compiled.
## Solution
It's neccessary to replace Javascript to strictly type TypeScript.  
Trully strict (without any).  
In this way browser can compile websites.
## Why webassembly is bad
One of the main principe of web is it open architecture.
WASM violences this and Typescript doesn't. 
## Website execution
We should use AppArmor or something similiar to control permissions.  
We can use corresponding Qt or GTK lib that provides HTML components.
